Ski Selector

This program is meant to help users in search of buying skis decide what to buy. Users may input their preferences relating to skiing in order to determine what some appropriate skis for them to buy would be. The end result is a list of 4 of the best skis for the user, along with pictures and additional information about each ski. From these options the user may choose their favorite and are provided with a link to purchase that ski.

All of the code in this project is orignal and written by me. I designed the form to sanitize and validate user responses using javascript and PHP. I also designed an SQL database to hold question/answer maps, data about the skis, and previously inputted responses. 

I plan to expand on this project in the future by improving the user interface and by contacting ski companies so they can opt to have their skis added to the database in order to become more discoverable to their customers. At some point I would like to make this a big enough platform that getting a ski on the site is a paid service.
